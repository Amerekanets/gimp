/**
 * gimp_help:
 * @prog_name: The plug-in's executable name or an empty string.
 * @help_page: The location of the help page.
 *
 * Load a help page.
 *
 * This procedure loads the specified help page into the helpbrowser or
 * what ever is configured as help viewer. The location of the help
 * page is given relative to the help rootdir. The help rootdir is
 * determined from the prog_name: if prog_name is NULL, we use the help
 * rootdir of the main GIMP installation, if the plug-in's full
 * executable name is passed as prog_name, the GIMP will use this
 * information to look up the help path the plug-in has registered
 * before with gimp-plugin-help-register.
 *
 * Returns: TRUE on success.
